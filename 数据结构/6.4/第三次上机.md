#Implement Your Own BST
## Prerequisites, Goals, and Outcomes
###Prerequisites: 
Students should have mastered the following prerequisite skills. 

* Binary Search Tree - Knowledge of Binary Search Tree and some operations of BST

###Goals: 
This assignment is designed to reinforce the student's understanding of the store and basic operations of BST.
###Outcomes: 
Students successfully completing this assignment would master the following outcomes.

* Understand the BST and its implementation

##Background
###Binary Search Tree
Binary Search tree is a binary tree in which each internal node x stores an element such that the element stored in the left subtree of x are less than or equal to x and elements stored in the right subtree of x are greater than or equal to x. This is called binary-search-tree property. 

The basic operations on a binary search tree take time proportional to the height of the tree. For a complete binary tree with node n, such operations run in θ(lg n)  worst-case time. If the tree is a linear chain of n nodes, however, the same operations takes θ({n}) worst-case time.

###Implementation of Binary Search Tree
Binary Search Tree can be implemented as a linked data structure in which each node is an object with two pointer fields. The three pointer fields left, right corresponding to the left child, right child respectively NIL in any pointer field signifies that there exists no corresponding child.

###Querying a Binary Search Tree

**The most common operations performed on a BST are searching for a key stored in the tree. Other operations are MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, SUCCESSOR and PREDESESSOR. These operations run in O (h) time where h is the height of the tree i.e., h is the number of links root node to the deepest node.**

The TREE-SEARCH (x, k) algorithm searches the tree root at x for a node whose key value equals k. It returns a pointer to the node if it exists, otherwise NIL

**TREE-SEARCH (x, k)**

```
if x = NIL   .OR.    k = key[x] 
then return x
if k < key[x]
    then return TREE-SEARCH (left[x], k)
else return TREE-SEARCH (right[x], k)
```

Clearly, this algorithm runs in O(h) time where h is the height of the tree. 

The iterative version of above algorithm is very easy to implement.

**ITERATIVE-TREE-SEARCH (x, k)**

```
while x not equal NIL     .AND.     key ≠ key[x] do 
         if k < key [x] 
                 then x ← left[x] 
                 else x ← right [x] 
	return x 
```

The TREE-MINIMUN (x) algorithm returns a point to the node of the tree at x whose key value is the minimum of all keys in the tree. Due to BST property, an minimum element can always be found by following left child pointers from the root until NIL is encountered.

**TREE-MINIMUM (x)**

```
while left[x] ≠ NIL do
    x ← left [x]
return x
```

Clearly, it runs in O(h) time where h is the height of the tree. Again thanks to BST property, an element in a binary search tree whose key is a maximum can always be found by following right child pointers from root until a NIL is encountered.

**TREE-MAXIMUM (x)**

```
while right[x] ≠ NIL do
    x ← right [x]
return x
```

Clearly, it runs in O(h) time where h is the height of the tree.
The TREE-SUCCESSOR (x) algorithm returns a pointer to the node in the tree whose key value is next higher than key [x].

**TREE-SUCCESSOR (x)**

```
if right [x] ≠ NIL
    then return TREE-MINIMUM (right[x])
    else y ← p[x]
        while y ≠ NIL     .AND.    x = right[y] do
                x ← y
                y ← p[y]
        return y
```

Note that algorithm TREE-MINIMUM, TRE-MAXIMUM, TREE-SUCCESSOR, and TREE-PREDESSOR never look at the keys.

**INSERTION**

To insert a node into a BST

1.	find a leaf at the appropriate place and 
2.	connect the node to the parent of the leaf.  

**TREE-INSERT (T, z)**

```
y ← NIL
x ← root [T]
while x ≠ NIL do
    y ← x
    if key [z] <  key[x]
        then x ← left[x]
        else x ← right[x]
p[z] ← y
if y = NIL 
    then root [T] ← z
    else if key [z] < key [y]
        then left [y] ← z
        else right [y] ← z
```
Like other primitive operations on search trees, this algorithm begins at the root of the tree and traces a path downward. Clearly, it runs in O(h) time on a tree of height h.
